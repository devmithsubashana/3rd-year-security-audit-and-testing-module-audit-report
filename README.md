# 3rd-year-security-audit-and-testing-module-audit-report
As part of my university coursework, I conducted a comprehensive internal cybersecurity audit simulation for the head office of a mid-sized bank (Doha Bank). The assignment was based on a real-world scenario where the bank needed to assess its compliance with ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS standards.

The audit focused on key areas such as:

 • Network security
 • Access control mechanisms
 • Endpoint and application security
 • Incident response preparedness
 • Third-party/vendor risk
 • Business continuity and disaster recovery

I identified critical security gaps and compliance issues that posed threats such as cyber attacks, data breaches, and financial fraud. Based on the findings, I developed a detailed security audit report and formulated a risk treatment plan to address vulnerabilities and enhance regulatory compliance.

Outcome:
Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience in preparing a professional security audit testing report, analyzing cybersecurity risks, and proposing effective mitigation strategies aligned with industry standards.
